# Game purchase streaming

The idea is to abandon the classic demo versions of games, where the content is cut down, which does not allow you to adequately evaluate the game. With streaming purchases, anyone can pay for the first hours of playing, and cancel at any time if they don't like the game. If the game turned out to be good, then after paying the full amount, it forever goes to the player's library
